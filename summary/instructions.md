Here are the basic steps:

1. **Install Redux and React-Redux** : You can install both of these libraries using npm or yarn. Here's the command you would use:

```
npm install redux react-redux
```

   or

```
yarn add redux react-redux
```

2. **Create a Redux Store** : The store holds the entire state of your application. You can create a store using the `createStore` function from the `redux` library.

```
import { createStore } from 'redux';

const initialState = {
  // initial state here
};

const reducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  // reducer logic here
};

const store = createStore(reducer);
```

1. **Create Redux Actions** : Actions are payloads of information that send data from your application to your store. They are the only source of information for the store. You can create actions like this:

```
const addTodo = (text) => {
  return {
    type: 'ADD_TODO',
    text
  };
};
```

1. **Create Redux Reducers** : Reducers specify how the application's state changes in response to actions sent to the store. Remember that reducers are pure functions, so they don't change the state or perform side effects, they just calculate a new state. Here's an example:

```
const todoReducer = (state = [], action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'ADD_TODO':
      return [...state, action.text];
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

1. **Connect Redux to React** : You can use the `Provider` component from `react-redux` to make the Redux store available to any nested components. Here's how you can do it:

```
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';

ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

1. **Use Redux in React Components** : You can use the `connect` function from `react-redux` to connect your React components to the Redux store. Here's an example:

```
import { connect } from 'react-redux';

const TodoList = ({ todos }) => (
  <ul>
    {todos.map((todo, index) => <li key={index}>{todo}</li>)}
  </ul>
);

const mapStateToProps = state => ({
  todos: state.todos
});

export default connect(mapStateToProps)(TodoList);
```

Remember, this is a basic introduction. Redux and React-Redux have many more features that you can use to manage the state of your application. I recommend checking out the official Redux documentation for more detailed information.
